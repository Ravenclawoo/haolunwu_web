I am a phd student at McGill and MILA supervied by Prof. Xue (Steve) Liu. 
My research interests include: Information Retrieval, Recommender System, FATE (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics), Causal Reasoning, and Web3. 
I am committed to using advanced AI techniques to build a better information environment.
The worst thing I can be is the same as everybody else.
